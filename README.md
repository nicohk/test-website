# test-website

Hello everyone!!

My name is Nicolas, and I am 19 years old and have just started to learn code. I have managed to do create the skeleton for my website
by myself, but I feel that I need a bit of a "push" to continue learning, which is why I plan to do a udacity nanodegree followed
by a bootcamp in the near future. The reason I want to learn coding is because I see it as a valuable skill to have in starting a business.
